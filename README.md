## Hello, world!
 
My name is Dr. Kris Stern (PhD HKU, 2021; MPhil HKUST, 2016; BSc CUHK, 2012) and I am a Software Engineer and Data Scientist currently based out in Hong Kong. I am interested in physics, astrophysics, geophysics (through GIS), and computer science as academic pursuits, and would like to apply artificial intelligence / machine learning / algorithm to such studies, whether it is related to work or for my private interests. I am also fascinated by data visualisation, especially in the exploratory analysis performed on data cubes of many dimensions.

In my spare time, I like to develop software and to understand the interplay between AI and human interactions. 

In my spare time I enjoy classical music (especially via private piano and violin studies), kendo, field hockey, cricket, baseball/softball, sports analytics, games development, history, public radio as well as TV (CBC, BBC, NPR), as well as current affairs.

## Writing and Blogging

I maintain a blog at [Medium](https://medium.com/@krisastern), which I have been using chiefly for satisfying Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2019 & 2020 requirements, as well as for et cetera.
